## Next steps

### x-tags versus Polymer

#### x-tags pros + cons

##### pros
* small (36k minified)
* seems stable
* foundation for bricks

##### cons
* only rudimentary support for templates (-> programatic approach needed)

#### Polymer pros + cons

##### pros

* feature-rich (may also be considered a con ;)
* much better template support, observables
* lively community

##### cons

* harder to understand
* very much in motion - features may breaks from version to version
* size is about 160k minified
* not official support for IE - unclear status for mobile browsers 



## todos

### cleanup

#### resources/scripts
still kept for reference during development of new javascript

#### resources/xslt
remove deprecated xslts

#### Zaphod
what to do about it? Is it still needed? Someone out there using it?

#### Check usage in test files

#### add 'todo' markers to mark occurrences that need discussion

#### remove dojo from reference forms
